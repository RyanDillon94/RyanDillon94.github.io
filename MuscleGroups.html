                <strong> Starting with the bro split...</strong><br />
                The bro split means working each muscle in its individual
                session. An example of the bro split would be:
            </p>
            <table class="center">
                <tr id="td">
                    <th>Monday</th>
                    <th>Tuesday</th>
                    <th>Wednesday</th>
                    <th>Thursday</th>
                    <th>Friday</th>
                </tr>
                <tr id="td">
                    <td>Back</td>
                    <td>Chest</td>
                    <td>Shoulders</td>
                    <td>Biceps</td>
                    <td>Triceps</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                As you can see, the bro split only allows you to work each
                muscle once per week. Although this split means you have longer
                per session to work with higher volume, two times per week per
                muscle is the optimum way to train.

            <h3>Push Pull Legs</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>My favourite way to train</strong>
                <br />The Push Pull Legs (PPL) split means working your full
                upper body twice per week.<br />
            </p>
            <h4>Push</h4>
            <p>
                During your Push days, you are training each muscle that
                performs the 'Push' motion. This includes exercises like the
                Bench Press, Shoulder Press and Tricep Pushdown.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Push = Chest, Shoulders and Triceps</strong></h5>
            <h4>Pull</h4>
            <p>
                During Pull days, any exercices that perform a 'Pull' motion
                will be worked. This includes exercises such as the Lat Pulldown
                or Bicep Curl.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Pull = Back and Biceps</strong></h5>
            <h4>Legs</h4>
            <p>Self explanatory... Legs!</p>
            <p>
                You can split this up in any way you like. Legs Push Pull, Push
                Pull Legs, Push Legs Pull etc etc...<br />
                The main thing in a Push Pull Legs routine is that you run
                through the three routines over and over, regardless of order,
                providing you don't do the same muscle group on consecutive
                days.

            <br />
            <h3>Full Upper Body</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Another one of my favourites...</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Full Upper means working your full upper body in each
                session. I would only recommend this if you have a day inbetween
                each session or combined with the Push Pull Legs. If i can only
                get three sessions per week I like to combine 2 days in a row
                with a Push Pull followed by a rest day, finished with a Full
                Upper.
            </p>

        <br />
        <div id="Full Body">
            <h3>Full Body</h3>
            <p>
                I <strong>rarely</strong> do Full Body sessions. They're great
                if you can only workout 2-3 times per week but thats not very
                often for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a Full Body session... you guessed it! You work every muscle
                per session.
