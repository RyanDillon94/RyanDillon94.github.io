  <h1>Routines</h1>
  <hr>
  <header>
    <p>
      Do you find yourself searching endlessly through workout pages on Google? Finding that every website has a different recommendation than the last? Leaving you with no idea which one you should follow...
    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
    <h2 class="center">Good News... There is no wrong answer!</h2>
    <p>
      The right workout is the workout that works for you.<br>
      You need to decide how many days per week you can workout, how long you will have per session and more importantly... What your goals are.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Workout frequency</h3>
    <p>
      I find that hitting each upper body muscle group twice per week works best for hypertrophy and muscle gain.<br>
      This means that you need a routine that gives you two sessions per muscle per week. You can spilt this up anyway you like, the important thing is that it fits your schedule.<br>
      My schedule changes a lot, especially if I need to factor in running. I find that I can make it to the gym most weekdays and I try to guarantee 4 sessions per week as a minimum. I decide my routine for the week each Monday. They usually look like this...
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="4 Day">
    <h3>4 Day Split</h3>
    <table class="center">
      <tr id="td">
                <th>Monday</th>
        <th>Tuesday</th>
        <th>Wednesday</th>
        <th>Thursday</th>
        <th>Friday</th>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
        <td>Legs</td>
        <td>Rest</td>
        <td>Full Upper Body</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this example, Thursday is my rest day. Depending on my schedule I may swap this with another day and/or move the routine around to different days. Sometimes I start the week with the full upper, followed by legs or rest and finishing with Push Pull. The main thing to consider is that your plan doesn't include working the same muscle on two consecutive days.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Heres another 4 day example.
    </h5>
    <table class="center">
      <tr id="td">
              <th>Monday</th>
        <th>Tuesday</th>
        <th>Wednesday</th>
        <th>Thursday</th>
        <th>Friday</th>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
        <td>Rest</td>
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this example, there is no leg day. I always recommend including a leg day in your weekly plan, but that's a recommendation that I don't always follow...<br>
      I may have ran a lot that week and my legs are already sore or I have an upcoming speed run that I want to be fresh for (<em> Both popular excuses I use</em>). Sometimes, I just don't feel like leg day or I met up with a friend and we match the workouts to socialise.<br> As mentioned previously though, I still hit all of my upper body twice.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="5 Day">
    <h3>5 Day Split</h3>
    <p>
      When I know I will be able to get to the gym 5 days, I go for the classic Push Pull Legs Push Pull. Foe me training only on weekdays, it will always look like this.
    </p>
    <table class="center">
        <tr id="td">
        <th>Monday</th>
        <th>Tuesday</th>
        <th>Wednesday</th>
        <th>Thursday</th>
        <th>Friday</th>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
        <td>Legs</td>
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      You can move leg day to whichever day you prefer. You could get it out the way on a Monday or save it till last on a Friday. <br>
      I find having it smack bang in the middle of the week works best for me and my running schedule. If running is light, I like doing legs on a Friday.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="3 Days">
    <h3>3 Day Split</h3>
    <p>
      You can structure a 3 day split in many ways. I would usually do a 3 day week with a Push, Pull, Rest then Full Upper, or Full Upper, Rest, Push then Pull. If my days are in a row, I would swap out the Full Upper for Legs. Depending on my schedule I may do two Full Upper sessions and legs. The table below includes a mixture of variables depending on your workout days.
      </p>
      <table class="center">
        <tr id="td">
        <th>Monday</th>
        <th>Tuesday</th>
        <th>Wednesday</th>
        <th>Thursday</th>
        <th>Friday</th>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
        <td>Legs</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
        <td>Full Upper</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Full Upper</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
        <td>Push</td>
        <td>Pull</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
      </tr>
      <tr id="td">
        <td>Full Upper</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
        <td>Full Upper</td>
        <td>Non Gym Day</td>
        <td>Legs</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
    <p>As you can see, there are many ways to structure a 3 day week. It all depends on your schedule.<br>
    For me, the main things are hitting the muscle twice per week and not doing the same muscle on consecutive days. Meet those 2 guidelines and you will make the most out of your limited sessions.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="2 Days">
    <h3>2 Day Split</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The absolute minimum.</strong><br>
      If you can only get to the gym for 2 days per week, you should be doing full body sessions. If it's two consecutive days... one upper body followed by one lower body.
      <br>Personally, if I can only get to the gym twice per week legs take a back seat and I do full upper body for both sessions.
    </p>
  </div>

<div id="Summary">
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>As you can see, there are many ways to split up your week.<br>
  When my running schedule has me prioritising my runs, I drop down to a 2-3 sessions per week routine consisting of full upper body workouts. During off season or inbetween races, I try to get a minimum of 4 sessions per week. <br>
  The Full Upper workouts are a great tool for ensuring you hit each muscle twice, but I prefer the Push Pull routine. I find with a Push Pull you a dedicating more time into each muscle instead of cramming everything into the one session. For example, if you have 60 minutes per session, that 60 minutes is better spent truly exhausting 3 muscles than squeezing what you can into 5.

  <h3>The 4 golden rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li class="ql">Hit each upper body muscle twice per week</li>
    <li class="ql">Ensure you don't work the same muscle two days in a row</li>
    <li class="ql">Try to hit legs atleast once a week</li>
    <li class="ql">2 sessions a week is better than none... <strong>but 4-5 is optimum</strong></li>
  </ol>
